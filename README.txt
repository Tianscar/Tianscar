Claims to be "Karstian Lee", you can also call me "Karl" or "Kara", depends on your opinion
It's "Karstian", not "Khristian" or "Karsten", I think it's a unique name ;)

Amateur programmer, well out of skill
Sometimes developing open source projects, but never been involved in any open source community
No account on StackOverflow

Prefer to use Java & C for development
Became a GNU/Linux user for no reason
Android developer, but Kotlin-free
Use Java AWT/Swing for desktop development, not more modern JavaFX or those popular and more mature frameworks (Qt, Electron, etc.)
In general, use a full IDE and modern build tools, such as JetBrains IDEA and Gradle

Couldn't learn Python & Haskell well
Refused to use Windows for several years, without any reason
Dislike .NET, although used to write some code in C# & Visual Basic .NET
